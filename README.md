As far as I know this is the first open source Bitcoin/others ATM, this ATM is designed to take in cash (via Arduino .ino to come) and read pulses. then convert them to cash.
This is sample right now so some testing code in.. Right now you SHOULD NOT put this in any live ATM. it lets you put money in Without actually inserting cash.  By 1/5/16 all code will be live that *SHOULD* be usable for live enviroments there will be a video on Techknow to check out for the introduction.
